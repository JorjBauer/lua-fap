Installation instructions:
**************************

0. Install libfap (http://pakettiradio.net/libfap/).

1. Edit the Makefile. You'll need to comment out the architecture blocks
   that don't pertain to your platform. (As of this writing, this package 
   works on MacOS 10.7 and Debian Squeeze. This will likely function on 
   other platforms as well, but I have not explicitly tested on them. If you 
   have a Makefile configuration that works on another platform, send me 
   email with your configuration so that I may include it in a future 
   verison.)

2. make

3. sudo make install

4. Enjoy.


*****
Bugs:
*****

* To install this properly, you must edit the Makefile. This should be 
  abstracted into autoconf (or something lighter weight to accomplish the 
  same thing).

* There is no test suite.

* Installation has been tested under MacOS 10.7 and Linux
  (specifically, Debian Squeeze). Other platforms should be tested.

* Much of this code is repurposed from my lua-cyrussasl module. Which
  means it should be abstracted in some common way, rather than
  copy-and-pasted.
